      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in grad school for a year now, so I figured now was as good of a time to reflect as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot of things I expected to learn, like how to write a paper, what’s the difference between a conference paper and a journal paper and how do you get grants to support your research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also was totally blindsided by a lot of other things, which mostly fall into the categories “Computery Things” (because my lab develops a ton of software) and “Social Things”. If you only care about one of those categories, you can skip the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-good-code-is-non-trivial&#34;&gt;Writing good code is non-trivial&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think I was a pretty good coder. I left comments and I tried not duplicate code everywhere. Then I start having code-reviews whenever I submitted code to our big software project Nengo, where my lab-mates reviewed everything I had written and made suggestion. These code-reviews have taught me so much in terms of habits, setups and intuition that I couldn’t have gotten anywhere else. This kind of scares me, because it means I have no idea how non-computery labs are supposed to get better. Post snippets of their code on &lt;a href=&#34;http://codereview.stackexchange.com/&#34;&gt;codereview.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt;? Walk down the hall to the computer science department and force them to sit down with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dev-ops-is-foundational&#34;&gt;Dev Ops is foundational&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any successful commercial software project to be able to evolve, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html&#34;&gt;the amount of time required for a new developer to get from interest to running code should be minimal&lt;/a&gt;. Not only that, but you should be able to log bugs, automatically run minimal tests and be able to quickly get the most updated code. All of these things fall under the umbrella of “Dev Ops”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dev Ops being important doesn’t stop being true when you’re a scientist writing scientific code, which is tragic because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dev Ops is freaking &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; You have to learn a bunch of different tools that haven’t been made non-hacker friendly yet. Travis-CI, whatever testing framework and builder your language uses (if it’s Matlab, good luck), and git (&lt;em&gt;shudder)&lt;/em&gt; suddenly go from become things you’ve heard of to things you need to understand &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dev Ops isn’t taught &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Not in Software Carpentry, Coursera and definitely not at your institution, so you need to wrangle together a bunch of tutorials from the Internet and sacrifice a mouse to the computer gods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these obstacles, it’s not surprising to learn that Dev Ops in scientific code is practically unheard of, even in widely distributed and used libraries. Before my Master’s degree I would have shrugged it off has not being a major problem in science, but now &lt;a href=&#34;https://bullshit.ist/why-im-an-open-source-nerd-an-apology-7d7a3e0e13e9#.f8rjqga4h&#34;&gt;I scream in horror&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;centralized-documentation-is-life-support&#34;&gt;Centralized documentation is life support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having your documentation to your project somewhere online, where anyone can propose edits, is the only way your project’s docs will remain up to date and thus the only way your software will be able to proliferate and survive. Luckily, unlike everything else in this article, there’s tons of solutions to this! I just don’t know which one to recommend to absolute beginners… Leave a comment and I’ll update this section?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-tooling-is-horrible&#34;&gt;Scientific tooling is horrible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of keeping up with research is reading a lot of papers. I thought for sure there would be tools for this everywhere. A unified program (I use a bunch of separate ones) that lets you tag papers, then search through the tags and annotations. A website where you can subscribe to feeds on research you’re interested in (lots of those exist) and collaboratively comment (nope) on publications. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuGVC8VqXz0&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;index=45&#34;&gt;Interactive drawing/coding tools&lt;/a&gt; for making complex animated figures. A thriving StackExchange where researchers bounce ideas off each other and drive synthesis of new concepts. Nope. Instead you get ResearchGate, Twitter, Mendeley, Google Draw and spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;




  &lt;/section&gt;

    
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-team-is-essential&#34;&gt;Your team is essential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lab-mates are important. I knew they were important, but I didn’t know just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; important. Without my lab-mate Aaron, I would have never published my first paper. Without my lab-mate Terry, I would have never been able to determine the appropriate scope for my initial research for that paper. Without my lab-mate Trevor, I would have never learned how to write good scientific software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;communicating-concepts-is-excavation&#34;&gt;Communicating concepts is excavation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think of myself as a pretty good communicator. I even put it on my resume. However, this year all evidence that I had of that was utterly and irrevocably refuted. This year was the year I learned Non-Violent Communication, which taught me how to talk about emotions and has literally changed my life, but that’s a whole other blog post. This was also the year where I routinely needed to quickly grasp concepts and relate them to my current knowledge so I could remember the faint outline of their importance for later. This technical communication style did not come easily for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s are a few tricks I use when teaching or learning from other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useful questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the last thing you understood?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you say what I just said back to me, but using different words?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the closest thing that you think you know to this concept?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you mean by… ? What did you think I meant by… ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When meeting with someone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be specific about what you need from them: “I want your help deciding… ?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you both leave with the same conclusion: “What I’m going to remember from this is… ? Is this what you wanted me to remember?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post-doc in my lab, Terry Stewart, has this down to an art form. To the point that I frequently like to watch him teach concepts to people just to see how he manoeuvres through their understanding like a hawk through a canyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I still need to work on my similes and metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mathematical-notation-is-a-foreign-language&#34;&gt;Mathematical notation is a foreign language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently have no idea how to communicate with mathematical concepts textually. I literally have to translate them from/to code. I learned this during my undergrad, where math made sense to me for the first time in my life after I learned how to program. However, I only realised serious it was this semester. I look at a sum and I think “Okay, a for-loop”. I see a chain of equations and I think “Where’s the source code?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, unless I’ve programmed something, like back-prop or the Neural Engineering Framework. I cannot say I truly understand it. This is a bit problematic at the moment, given my immense confusion with the following things which I need to rectify in the next 7 months and I’m not sure they’re easy to code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. What are those things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do Restricted Boltzmann Machines use Monte-Carlo Markov-Chains to optimise themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is sensor fusion still such a big, open topic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Power of Now and The Dangers of Bullshit</title>
      <link>https://seanaubin.github.io/post/2016-09-15-The-Power-of-Now-and-The-Dangers-of-Bullshit/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://seanaubin.github.io/post/2016-09-15-The-Power-of-Now-and-The-Dangers-of-Bullshit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[epistemic status: a structured, but ultimately somewhat ranty warning against self-help books and their bullshit with the hope of saving others time]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time in my life when everything sucked, so I started to read self-help books, based off of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raptitude.com/2013/02/five-self-help-books-that-actually-helped/&#34;&gt;this list from Raptitude&lt;/a&gt;. The first book off that list was “This is How”, which along for “Man’s Search for Meaning” is one of the most inspirational books I’ve ever read. The second one was “The Power of Now” (TPN) which I simultaneously loved (sharing verses with my friends and family) and hated (literally screaming out loud in agony after reading some sentences). There is no denying the author writes excellent practical prose. Unfortunately, he doesn’t stick to applied mindfulness and veers off into pseudo-profound bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TPN is a classic among self-help books and it’s easy to see why given its parallels to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@seanaubin/debugging-your-thoughts-with-mind-maps-94aeecd2821d#.96p14ixwy&#34;&gt;I’m a big fan of&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like CBT, TPN encourages you to identify unhelpful, repetitive thought patterns and assess their usefulness to the present state. Does calling yourself a failure and a disappointment actually help you perform better or does it just make you afraid to try? What happens if you stop focusing on those labels and instead focus on systematically what you can do to perform better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TPN also encourages being aware of emotions, as an indication of thoughts you might not be recognising. If you immediately tense when entering a meeting, maybe you should review if that reaction is sensible or helpful. Where is it coming from? What thought or belief triggers it? Do you think that you are unable to get any idea across in when there are more than two people involved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, TPN makes an explicit distinction between worrying and dwelling versus planning and learning from the past. TPN urges you to either take action or if this is not possible, schedule to take action later. Whatever you do, don’t hold it in you head and waste precious processing resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good! And then comes the bullshit…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit has been defined delightfully by Frankurt in his book &lt;em&gt;On Bullshit&lt;/em&gt;. However, &lt;a href=&#34;http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923ac/jdm15923acr.pdf&#34;&gt;my favourite definition of bullshit comes from Gordon Pennycook&lt;/a&gt;, who defines bullshit as being “ something that is constructed without concern for the truth. By this definition, bullshit statements can be true, false, or meaningless. The absence or presence of these factors is irrelevant to something being bullshit. Nonetheless, although bullshit statements can be incidentally true, bullshit is generally false and hence, often problematic.” Pennycook also emphasises how it’s generally “design[ed] to impress”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is usually seen in pseudo-science or spirituality (Deepak Chopra is a great example), where the words “toxins”, “forces”, “consciousness” and “organic” are stripped of their scientific meaning and used to give illusions of grandeur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part is, it’s partly our fault as science communicators for falling for the easy metaphor that helps spread this bullshit. Consequently, I hereby urge myself and other scientists to consider the following before using a metaphor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicate the limitations of the metaphor and its motivation. What are you trying to give a feel for? What does this feel explain and what doesn’t it explain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give directions to opportunities for more in depth knowledge. Whether this be other articles or StackExchange Communities specialising in that form of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlight the limits of current scientific knowledge and why the field is still being pursued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But I have a limited space of text to dedicate to the spread of knowledge!” I know and the fact that &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@seanaubin/mind-maps-for-augmented-thinking-communication-24a7d949388d#.673ghom5w&#34;&gt;we haven’t invented a better form of communication given the advent of computers&lt;/a&gt; may be one of humanities greatest tragedies. But until humanity gets its act together, we might as well face the reality that text is still a dominant communication medium and accept the responsibility to use it as effectively and safely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool. I’m glad we’ve got that sorted out, now let’s go back to TPN for some practical examples of bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TPN is a repeat offender of spreading pseudo-profound bullshit in its second half, which is weird since its first half is so practical. It’s like the author wrote the first part talking to people about their problems and the second half while tripping on acid. They go from giving actionable suggestions to unleashing an avalanche of meaningless buzzwords in the space of one chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, butchering theoretical physics while talking about meditation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also raises the vibrational frequency of the energy field that gives life to the physical body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then using this bullshit to justify magical thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more consciousness you direct into the inner body, the higher its vibrational frequency becomes, much like a light that grows brighter as you turn up the dimmer switch and so increase the flow of electricity . At this higher energy level , negativity cannot affect you anymore, and you tend to attract new circumstances that reflect this higher frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making hilariously general claims about consciousness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that exists has Being, has God-essence, has some degree
of consciousness. Even a stone has rudimentary consciousness;
otherwise, it would not be, and its atoms and molecules would
disperse. Everything is alive. The sun, the earth, plants, animals,
humans — all are expressions of consciousness in varying degrees,
consciousness manifesting as form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dismissing the Scientific method as confirmation bias:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists study space, they usually make it into something and thereby miss its essence entirely . Not surprisingly , the latest theory is that space isn’t empty at all , that it is filled with some substance. Once you have a theory , it’s not too hard to find evidence to substantiate it, at least until some other theory comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grouping anti-depressants with alcohol:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it weren’t for alcohol, tranquillisers, antidepressants, as well as the illegal drugs, which are all consumed in vast quantities, the insanity of the human mind would become even more glaringly obvious than it is already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claiming that meditation can cure all illnesses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that you can do
whenever you feel the need to boost your immune system. It is
particularly effective if used when you feel the first symptoms of an
illness, but it also works with illnesses that are already entrenched if
you use it at frequent intervals and with an intense focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one common thread in all these examples; they don’t mean/explain anything. They have no basis in evidence, don’t help you learn from your past or avoid pitfalls in your future and give you no further avenues for investigation, all while crowding out more helpful explanations. They are purest bullshit and should be addressed as so, by dismissing them in their entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, all of my concerns with TPN come down to the spread of bullshit. TPN aims to impress and empower with these passages without concern for their outside damage. I can only hope that the readers of TPN are more mindful than its author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you liked this article and want to read more book reviews and summaries of psychological therapeutic research, consider&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://uwaterloo.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=d5612fe997cc72aac70c4ffe9&amp;amp;id=76226838bc&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;subscribing to my mailing list&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
