# TODO:

- We still have to include all the anotations from before
- Clicking on the title should also bring you home
- Move the PDFs of my background and the CV of failures off the lab server
- Switch to a less restrictive copyright
- Add the startup ideas by making a separate feed for them
- Add an RSS feed, because mailing lists are for jerks

# Bonus:

- Shove in a logo
- Make clicking the title or the logo bring you back home
- Fix the favicon to something not stupid
