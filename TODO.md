# TODO:

- Add an about page with various resumes
- Add redirect links from `seanny123.github.io`
- We still have to include all the annotations from before
- Stick the `@media` CSS back in so the views aren't as wonky on mobile.
- The bulleted lists still look weird (probably due to interactions with annotations)
- Move the PDFs of my background and the CV of failures off the lab server
- Add the startup ideas by making a separate feed for them
- Add an RSS feed, because mailing lists are for jerks
- Make all the Mindmups embedded, with resizable iframes or something by using a shortcode
- Figures should be centered
- Add link to RSS feed and mailing list to header
- Add encouragements to reach out to the footer
- Make a script for Mindmups that:
    - Removes Google Analytics, Twitter and OpenGraph stuff
    - Change the mapjs reference
    - Removes the awkwardly embedded CSS source

# Bonus:

- Shove in a logo
- Fix the favicon to something not stupid
- Find a way to identify previously used tags to avoid duplicates
- Make Mindmaps clickable so people know to open them in a new window
- Create redirect links for all the weird case-sensitive Hugo URLs
