No one wants to read a series of blog posts about the various tools I use on a daily basis and how I feel about them. But maybe someone wants to read one blog post? Here it is in one place.

## Love
**Bandcamp** You let me buy and download music for all my favourite artists and then you get the hell out of my way.

**MindMup** You’re still the only mind-mapping solution that works for me.

**TagSpaces** You make my research make sense.

**Pocket** Thanks for helping me realize that most articles I think I want to read, I actually only want to read at the time because I’m bored.

**CamScanner** When just signing a PDF isn’t acceptable, you enable me to not going on a hunt for someone who still owns a printer/scanner.

**TrulyErgonomic Keyboard** The gateway drug of ergonomic keyboards.

## Hate
**Android** Who do I have to kill to get a phone that is regularly updated? Also, can we please get a [secure system](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/11/24/android-n-encryption/) with the next version?

**Itunes** I don’t need you to sync, I need you to let me drop in a folder into my file-system and for you to discover it.

**Ubuntu** Why the hell do I have to download a package to get sane power management.

**Windows** I know you’re super-secure and you’re still the OS I trust my grandfather with, but you’ve made it impossible to move a window between virtual desktops with a keyboard shortcut. For this, I will never forgive you.

**PDFs** I know why you exist, but it doesn’t make me hate you any less. You make me have to use other tools like `pdfgrep` just to search through you and you’re stunting the progress of scientific communication.
