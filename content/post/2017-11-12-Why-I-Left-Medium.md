**They kept changing the damn layout on me.** I specifically chose Medium because they allowed you to have little side-notes shown at the same time as your main article. Then they made those side-notes "replies" even though they clearly weren’t the same thing as the existing "replies".

**Medium limits what I can put on the web.** If I want a table, an embedded Mindmup or anything else, I’m screwed. If I want my diagrams to be SVG or I want to create simulations, I’m even more screwed.

**The export format is atrocious.** I just wanted to convert my articles into Markdown and that was not easily done. I don’t trust them to let me leave with the rest of my content if things get worse or if I want to switch to a decentralized solution.

**There’s no version control.** I can’t see what I’ve changed and how I’ve changed it over time.

**The bright layout literally hurts my eyes.** I’m sensitive to light, so I can’t look at bright web-pages too long without getting a head-ache and becoming nauseous. I’ve solved this partially with [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html), but it’s not a very durable solution.

**The page size is ridiculous.** My [book review for "The Entrepreneurial State"](https://seanny123.github.io/post/2017-05-09-Book-Review-The-Entrepreneurial-State/) is literally 10 times smaller on my new website than when it was hosted on Medium. This means faster load times and a wider reach.

That being said, I am going to miss the WYSIWYG editor and the instant change visibility.
