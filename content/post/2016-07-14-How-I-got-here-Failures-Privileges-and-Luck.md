A while ago, I was talking to my friend who was over-idealising me as a result of reading [my CV](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/people/aubin-cv.pdf). She was despondent about the prospect about ever achieving as much as I had, regardless of the field she chose to pursue. Naturally, I exploded with laughter. I got to my current amateurish position in my field of cognitive modelling in a [hilariously roundabout manner](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/people/seanaubin/neurotweep_background.pdf) and I hardly consider myself successful.

However, my friend’s misperception is a common one, which is why a bunch of academics have started publishing, not only a “CV of Failures”, but an additional one of “Luck and Privileges” to give something closer to the truth.

So without further ado, here is my own [CV of Failures, Rejections, Luck and Privileges](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/people/seanaubin/alt-cv.pdf), which I’m sure will grow as my career progresses. Let it never be said that I try to project an aura of aloofness.
