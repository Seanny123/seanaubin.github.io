#### And why StackExchange works

*\[epistemic status: exasperated rant trying to disguise itself as a persuasive essay\]*

If you want to get a question answered by a fellow professional in an academic domain (physics, biology, neuroscience), you have a few options:

-   

    ResearchGate
-   

    Quora
-   

    StackExchange


They all share a common purpose. You go there to get your question answered by other people. However, not all questions are created equal.

Let’s look at what questions you can find on those sites. First, StackExchange:

{{< figure
  src="/img/Quora-and-ResearchGate-are-horrible_0.png"
  class=""
  title=""
  caption=""
  label=""
  attr=""
  attrlink=""
  alt=""
  link=""
 >}}
{{< section "end" >}}

We have questions sorted by tags and votes. Off-topic or poorly asked questions are *on hold* waiting for clarification from the original poster.

Second, ResearchGate:

{{< figure
  src="/img/Quora-and-ResearchGate-are-horrible_1.png"
  class=""
  title=""
  caption="One reasonable question out of three isn’t bad?"
  label=""
  attr=""
  attrlink=""
  alt=""
  link=""
 >}}
{{< section "end" >}}

Two really vague questions and one well-phrased. Not bad considering the interface is 30% profile information placed before you can even read the question.

Lastly, here’s Quora:

{{< figure
  src="/img/Quora-and-ResearchGate-are-horrible_2.png"
  class=""
  title=""
  caption=""
  label=""
  attr=""
  attrlink=""
  alt=""
  link=""
 >}}
{{< section "end" >}}

One vague question, two questions asking for general advice and no indication of the quality of the questions.

What’s the difference in approaches that results in these different distributions in question quality?

## Curation
Questions are filtered based on scope.

Questions that don’t get filtered get assessed. They’re improved if possible by suggesting edits. The user can then see the edits.

## Separate avenues for discussion and answers
Ideally, a StackExchange thread contains a question and multiple answers. Sometimes it has comments. If those comments get unwieldy, you go to Chat.

{{< figure

  class=""
  title=""
  caption=""
  label=""
  attr=""
  attrlink=""
  alt=""
  link=""
 >}}
{{< section "end" >}}

{{< figure
  src="/img/Quora-and-ResearchGate-are-horrible_4.png"
  class=""
  title=""
  caption="Yay an ad right where I’m looking for a discussion"
  label=""
  attr=""
  attrlink=""
  alt=""
  link=""
 >}}
{{< section "end" >}}

Oh great, they’re nested. That means there’s a whole other discussion going on here to be sucked into.

This is why chat exists.

## Quality of answer over authority of source
The reputation and name of the person is at the bottom of the answer and the question.

## Moderation
StackExchange has *elected* moderators. Everyone contributes to moderation in a certain degree.

## You own your answer
On StackExchange, [answers are licensed](https://stackexchange.com/legal) under a [Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license. [Quora takes a more restrictive approach](https://www.quora.com/about/tos) and does not seem to even require attribution. More worryingly, [they block web-crawlers, including the Internet Archive](https://konklone.com/post/quora-keeps-the-worlds-knowledge-for-itself). I couldn’t even find the ResearchGate Q&A policy in [their copyright statement](https://www.researchgate.net/application.IntellectualPropertyPolicy.html), so I’m assuming they own all content you create.

## Singular Purpose
StackExchange science-related sites have the single purpose of getting “[expert answers to advanced questions](https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/tour)” in the defined field and is very explicit about it’s scope as the intersection between existing services:

{{< figure
  src="/img/Quora-and-ResearchGate-are-horrible_8.png"
  class=""
  title=""
  caption=""
  label=""
  attr=""
  attrlink=""
  alt=""
  link=""
 >}}
{{< section "end" >}}

Yes, there is are job postings on StackOverflow and a CV search, but they’re completely separate sites, thus keeping the focus on Q&A.

ResearchGate is a little more awkward… Their mission is “connect the world of science and make research open to all.” But their execution is somewhat closer to what would happen if LinkedIn, Discourse, Google Reader and Academia inbred for several generations and then had a child.

[Quora is “a place to share knowledge” to “understand the world and the people in it”](https://www.quora.com/about). This seems to equally describe my local pub, given there are no stated constraints on what knowledge is being shared or the people I’m meeting. Maybe more accurate description would be a walled-garden competitor to Medium (reading from inspiring people), Twitter (a personalized feed) and Yahoo Answers (bringing people together to answer poorly worded and excessively subjective questions).

In summary: for the love of science, *run*, don’t walk, away from the platforms of ResearchGate and Quora. Come to StackExchange if you want. At the very least, if you’re dedicated to those platforms, make your voice heard to help make them better. The ideas I’ve mentioned above aren’t patented and can be adopted!
