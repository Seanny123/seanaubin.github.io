At it's core, Twitter and Tear Gas by Dr. Zeynep Tufekci is a delightful deep analysis of the structure of modern protest movements and the technologies that support them. Subjectively, it brought up a lot of things I knew were bad and then shoved them in my face so I couldn't ignore them anymore.

## I.

The meat of Twitter and Tear Gas comes from contrasting the modern protest movements of Occupy and Tahrir Square to more "classic" movements. In particular, she shows how the main demonstrations of the American Civil Rights Movement, such as the Montgommery Bus Boycott and the "March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom", required tons of logistical overhead and an established hierarchy. To boycott the buses, car pools had to be organized. For the March on Washington, lunches needed to be provided, a sound system acquired and country-wide transportation scheduled. However, to organize medical supplies for Tahrir Square required three people working remotely, a shared spreadsheet on Google Drive and Twitter.

Besides logistical efficiency, the "horizontal" (as opposed to hierarchical) organisation of modern protest movements comes with other advantages, such as:

- Allowing faster scaling up of the movement.
- Increasing the difficulty of disabling the movement by removing key people.

However, this "horizontal" organisation also prevents a movement from adapting once they've scaled up. Both Tahrir Square and Occupy failed to convert their mass gatherings into any sort of political will. That being said, this tendency is not destiny. The Tea Party, despite it's horizontal organisation, greatly affected local politics due to their intimate understanding of legislation procedure. Black Lives Matter, with their singular goal, has significantly shifted the discourse around the justice system, so that "tough on crime" is no longer a political no-brainer and police violence receives greater scrutiny.

If the book ended here, you might leave a bit disappointed in the ability for groups to organize despite liberating technology. However, this is where Dr. Tufekci comes with the knockout punch of information inundation or "fake news".
{% sidenote "echo-chambers" "Dr. Tufecki technically also talks about \"echo chambers\", but I'm more skeptical of them. I think the concern is a bit over-hyped (see [this collection of research](https//cogsci.stackexchange.com/q/17364/4397)), even though I totally agree with the idea of \"fake news\" being a horrible mess. I think there's a difference between finding people that agree with you and being fooled by constant inundation of information and doubt when honestly trying to question things presented to you. While \"echo chambers\" assume people aren't even trying, \"fake news\" instead claims they just don't have the tools to differentiate all the claims. This feels more realistic." %} Basically, given that governments and other organisations can no longer control access to information, they make interpreting information nearly impossible by disrupting it's flow via distration and misinformation.


Dr. Tufecki covers the topic of "fake news" in a whirlwind of examples:
- Professionally taken photos, such as drowned refugees off the coast of Greece, have been robbed of their impact as the waters are muddied by claims of "Hoax!" and "Photoshopped!".
- Russia has used conspiracy theories and rumour to raise public dissent when Sweden considered joining NATO.
- China is using an army of internet commentators to ask distracting questions and derail the conversation of any group geographically close enough to organise.
- Given the difficulty of censoring Twitter, Turkey made it immoral to use instead.

These tactics can turn an active movement into a passive state of confused hopeless that Adam Curtis describes as "[oh dear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcy8uLjRHPM)".


## II.

Dr. Tufekci offers no easy solutions to this, given it's a developping situation with a lot of ongoing research. However, on her Twitter she emphasises the importance of funding movements and in the book she does hint at the possibility of software such as [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/). Consequently, after finishing the book, I felt my brain turn into overdrive as it reconsidered the question of information and attention management from various angles, while trying to avoid surrendering to hopelessness.

TODO: how is Loomio related to liquid democracy?

Being a naive computery engineer, I naturally have illusions of grandeur and imagine global trust networks. Where sources of information are given priority based on how often they are truthful and when wrong, how well they correct themselves. Implemented on a the Ethereum blockchain? SURE. WHY NOT THROW SOME MORE TECHNO MEMES INTO THIS MESS. Maybe free and decentralized software, like the Twitter-replacement [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/about) or [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), is innately different?

Oh god and machine learning capabilities are just going to make it easier to fake information...

TODO: You can't sign a photo to a device at the point of creation, just like DRM can't verify which device you're using to watch something. These things can be emulated. However, you should be able to immediately upload something to a 3rd party server after, making forgery more difficult, by at least requiring someone to hack a server. Additionally, machine learning is super sensitive to adversarial examples and leaves computationally perceptible signatures. However, this kind of drills down to "why do we trust anyone ever".

While we're at it, can we save local news investigative reporting somehow? I don't like buying local newspapers, because so much of it is junk. I really just want a hyper-investigative person to keep tabs on city hall. Maybe I can help fund this type of content uncounsciously with the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/)? But how does that not also encourage "fake news"?

In addition to computery improvements, I think there might be some possible innovation from a philosophical and psychological standpoint. Looking at the newest UK election, [people seem to be getting better at resisting bullshit](https://boingboing.net/2017/06/11/attention-snakeoil.html)? Maybe if we [re-focus on shared values, rather than political stances](https://medium.com/what-to-build/nothing-to-be-done-bfe2ce71a3a2
), we're less like to end up at each-other's throats? We're less likely to virtue signal and instead engage with people?

## III.

To summarize, If you want deeply human stories that bring urgent issues to the surface, read "Twitter and Tear Gas". Lack of money is no excuse, given the book is licensed under Creative Commons. If you know of any tentative solutions to the problems, please let me know so I can feel a slight bit of hope among all this despair.
