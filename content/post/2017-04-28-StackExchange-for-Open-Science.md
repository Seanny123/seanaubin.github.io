The next time you have to figure something out, to make sure you understand it, leave a question/answer pair on the [StackExchange dedicated to your branch of science](https://stackexchange.com/sites#science-traffic).

## You’re helping yourself the most

When taking notes, the best way is to restructure the knowledge you’re trying to store. Writing the notes in public so other people can read them and jump in on your trail of reasoning forces you to do this restructuring. And by “other people”, I include your future self who’s forgotten you even had the question in the first place.

## It will make you a better writer

In my experience, the difference between a good writer and a bad one is how much feedback they’ve gotten. On StackExchange, [people are incentivized to suggest edits to your question](https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/editing). These edits are then reviewed by the community. Consequently, it’s common to revisit your question and find it greatly improved with carefully explained edits you can learn from.

## Everyone will be nice

[Or we’ll kick them out](https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice). StackExchange has excellent moderation tools and *elected* moderators. This means the community is always being led by it’s most enthusiastic members, not just the bitter old people who’ve been around the longest.

## Shorter/easier than a blog post

Blog posts are hard. You have to consider an intended audience, a scope and a structure. With StackExchange, all of these choices are made for you. The audience is other people looking for the answers to the same question. The scope depends on the StackExchange site. The structure is a short question and answer. I’ve written maybe 20 blogs posts, but I’ve written almost [200 questions and answers](https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/users/4397/seanny123?tab=profile), because it’s so much easier.

## Direct feedback

With my blog, I get two metrics: visits and comments. With a question, I get to know if I helped someone else by visits, but also upvotes. I get to be notified if my answer has become out of date with comments left by other users. By reading other answers to the same question, I get to know if my answer wasn’t as complete as it could have been.

Try it. It doesn't have to be a long-term commitment.
